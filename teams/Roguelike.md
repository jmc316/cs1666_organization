## Game Description

The game will be a Top-Down Roguelike shooter game with 8-directional movement. The player will be a slime that can absorb enemy's abilities or weapons, and will navigate through a procedurally generated maze to get to a boss. There will be 3 levels of the dungeon, each level getting larger and more difficult. For each level, there will be a boss room, some obtainable upgrades. and a maze of rooms that have enemies, puzzles, or upgrades. The player will be forced to think consciously and intelligently about where to travel in the level, which abilities to absorb, how to unlock secret areas, and how to fight the boss.


## Advanced Topic Description

### Procedural Generation

Description: The procedural generation team will implement this idea to generate random maps to make each dungeon run a bit different from each other. This will make it so that the game feels more dynamic to the player.
    
### Physics Engine

Description: A physics engine which will simulate rigid body physics with friction, mass and force. There will be barrels that explode and send shrapnel that bounces off of objects and some weapons will have projectiles that bounce. In addition explosions and specific weapons will produce knockback. 

## Midterm Goals

* Fully playable, simplified first stage
* Sprites (Player + Enemies) displayed on screen
* Health system + HUD
* Base-level abilities functional

## Final Goals

* 15%: Implement absorbing mechanic
* 25%: Implement procedural generation
* 10% 2-3 weapons and abilities and 5 enemies
* 25%: Add the rigid body simulation


## Stretch Goals

* Add in an extra character class
* Add a persistent currency for unlocks that carries over between runs
